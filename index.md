  Hello! My name is Mohammadreza Dindarloo, and I have recently completed my Masterâ€™s degree in Control Engineering from [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/). My research primarily focuses on optimization problems in robotics, including state estimation, calibration, and sensor fusion.

</div>

  <p>
    Since September 2019, I have been a research associate at the [ARAS (Applied Robotics and AI Solutions)](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/) laboratory under the supervision of [Prof. Hamid D. Taghirad](https://aras.kntu.ac.ir/taghirad/). My work at ARAS has concentrated on the development of surgical and cable-driven robotic systems, with a particular emphasis on embedded systems, robotic control, and advanced optimization techniques.

<strong> August, 2017 </strong> - I've been working on my private pilot license (PPL) this summer at Burlington Executive Airport (CZBA). After two months of training, I finished my first solo flight (which means I was the only person in the aircraft). If you're interested in seeing the whole flight, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kE3_-Uywr4U">
